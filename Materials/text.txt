It is often said that friends are the family we choose. It is not uncommon for people to gravitate towards friends who share their interests, beliefs, and opinions. However, there are two opposing views on this subject. Some people argue that it is better to have friends who always agree with them, while others believe that friends who sometimes disagree with them are more valuable. In this essay, I will discuss both views. However, I think having friends who sometimes disagree helps us learn and grow. On the one hand, people who argue that it is better to have friends who always agree with them believe that this helps to avoid conflicts and maintain peace in relationships. They think that having the same opinions makes it easier to communicate and reduces the chances of arguments or misunderstandings. When there is a disagreement, it can cause tension and lead to the end of the friendship. Therefore, it is better to surround oneself with people who think alike and have the same values. On the other hand, people who believe that it is good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them, argue that this helps in personal growth and learning. They think that when there are disagreements, it encourages critical thinking and helps to challenge one's own beliefs and opinions. Such friends can provide new perspectives and insights that can broaden one's understanding of the world. Furthermore, it helps to develop better communication skills and learn how to navigate disagreements and conflicts in a healthy way. In my opinion, it is better to have friends who sometimes disagree with me. While it can be comforting to have friends who always agree with us, it does not challenge us to grow or learn. Disagreements and differing opinions are essential for personal growth and development. Having friends who challenge our ideas and beliefs can help us to broaden our perspectives and learn from different viewpoints. In conclusion, though friendship often means agreement among people, it is better to have friends who sometimes challenge us and help us grow. Disagreements and differing opinions are essential for personal growth and development, and having friends who share different perspectives can help us to become better individuals.
